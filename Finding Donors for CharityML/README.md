# Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview

In this project, I applied supervised techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 
### Steps:
1) **Explore the data** to learn how the census data is recorded. 
2) **Applying a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques** to manipulate the data into a workable format.
3) **Evaluating several supervised learners** on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
4) **Optimizing the model**.
5) **Explore the model** and its predictions under the hood; to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.


## Project Highlights

This project is designed to get acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

## Software Requirements

I used in this project the following software and Python libraries:
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3912/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Panads](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


## The Project Files

This project contains three files:
- finding_donors.ipynb: The main file.
- census.csv: The project dataset.
- visuals.py: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes.
