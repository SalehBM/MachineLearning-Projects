# Identify Customer Segments

## Project Overview
In this project, we applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that we have use it has been provided by udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
